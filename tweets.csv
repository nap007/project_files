"3","@sardesairajdeep Just keep your mouth shut. I am astonished to see how much double-standard can a person have."
"4","@snsachinnandu Bhai doctor, your analysis is completely wrong this time.
1. Fall of MP Govt
2. A very sane person out of Congress. Makes Congress look more stupid now.
3. Sound influence in some parts of MP."
"5","@JM_Scindia It is a very good decision. Always wondered how a honest and dynamic leader like you could remain in Congress for so long."
"6","@Maraba112 @SenMikeLee H1 is being flooded by Indians because people from other countries are directly transitioning from F1(student) visa to Green card."
"7","@BhavikaKapoor5 Firstly, India is not kicking out people living legally in India.
Secondly USA also provide asylum to people facing religious prosecution.
Thirdly USA also has green card quota for countries.
So above three points are also similar to what India is doing now."

"10","@anmarthi @DrGPradhan So do you think Shiv Sena is any less corrupt than NCP and Congress?"
"11","@AmyMaldonadoLaw EB category green cards are for work related  cards only. Employers can decide whether to sponsor someone in H1 for green card or not. From your above reply, I am convinced now that you dont want to solve this problem. I dont see how people can do jobs without first being on H1"
"12","@AmyMaldonadoLaw @SenatorDurbin Please read my comment above and decide for yourself. Do either of the above. Otherwise it is creating lots of problems for India born people for no fault of their."
"13","@AmyMaldonadoLaw Number of h1s per year around 85000. Number of employee green cards per year around 140000. So if green card doesnt have country quota like H1, there will be no backlog for anybody. And if you still want to keep country wise quota for green card, then introduce it for H1 too."

"16","@snsachinnandu Pradhan is a big corrupt person. Better to throw him away. Keeping him face of Odisha will cost BJP badly in assembly elections."
"17","@gdineshonnet @IamIconoclast @SharanRoars @TodaysChanakya @YRDeshmukh @pradip103 Remove CSDS. I have never seen any of their opinion polls correct. In some cases their exit polls predict the winner but the seats are quite off the mark."
